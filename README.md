<h1 align="center">My personal site from 2021</h1>

This is the second iteration of [my website](https://fpsvogel.com), built with [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/). I wrote [a tutorial showing how I built it](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/build-a-blog-with-bridgetown/).

I used this project as a stepping stone from pure Ruby to Rails, at a time when Rails was still intimidating to me. I decided to rebuild [my old blog](https://github.com/fpsvogel/blog-2020) using Bridgetown.

The part I'm proudest of is the plugin that builds [the Reading page](https://fpsvogel.com/reading/) of my site with the help of [my gem that parses my CSV reading log](https://github.com/fpsvogel/reading). You can read more about that [in my blog post on this project](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/build-a-blog-with-bridgetown#2-ruby-component-and-plugin).

One of these days I'm going to remake the site, again with Bridgetown, but I'm pleased that even as the newbiest of newbies, I could have fun building a site in Ruby thanks to Bridgetown.
