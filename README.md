<h1 align="center">My personal site</h1>

This is [my website](https://fpsvogel.com), built with [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/). I wrote [a tutorial showing how I built it](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/build-a-blog-with-bridgetown/).

This is possibly my favorite ongoing project. Originally I merely aimed to rebuild [my old blog](https://github.com/fpsvogel/blog-2020) using Bridgetown, and I intended it as a stepping stone from pure Ruby to Rails, at a time when Rails was still intimidating to me. It served that purpose admirably, but Bridgetown is such a joy that now, years later, I still tinker with and occasionally expand my site just for fun.

The parts I'm proudest of are the plugin that builds the [Reading List](https://fpsvogel.com/reading/) and [Reading Stats](https://fpsvogel.com/reading-stats/) pages, with the help of [my gem that parses my CSV reading log](https://github.com/fpsvogel/reading). You can read more about how the Reading List page is built [in my blog post on building the site](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/build-a-blog-with-bridgetown#2-ruby-component-and-plugin).
