I'm Felipe, a self-taught Rubyist who used to be a humanities teacher.

Take a look at [my "Learning Ruby" list](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby) if you're an aspiring developer and/or interested in Ruby. Helping other beginners is also a goal of my blog here, but it's equally a place where I reflect on what and and how I'm learning.
