Howdy! I'm Felipe Vogel, software engineer and Rubyist.

I'm a full-stack developer who relishes the multi-faceted challenges of architecting a scalable and maintainable back end with an intuitive, delightful UI.

I also love fostering a culture of learning in engineering teams, as well as mentoring at places like [Exercism](https://exercism.org/profiles/fpsvogel/testimonials).

Fun facts about me:

- **I used to be a humanities teacher** in a former career that took me all the way to West Africa.
- **I grew up in Brazil** in southern Amazonia, regularly living with the Jarawara indigenous people (whose village you can see [on Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RiiDxSkuyz9ATJpL7)—be sure to switch to satellite view).
- **I'm a big Latin nerd.** In grad school, I got to take most of my classes in Latin and lived in the *domus Latina* (Latin house), where we spoke only Latin except when we had guests… which, as you might guess, was rare.
- **My favorite "just for fun" books** are [*What If?*](https://what-if.xkcd.com/) and [*William Shakespeare's Star Wars*](https://iandoescher.com/william-shakespeares-star-wars/).
