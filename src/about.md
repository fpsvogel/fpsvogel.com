Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Felipe Vogel, a full-stack developer and Rubyist.

I love learning and practicing with other people who like to challenge themselves.

Fun facts about me:

- **I used to be a humanities teacher** in a former career that took me all the way to West Africa.
- **I grew up in Brazil** in southern Amazonia, regularly living with the Jarawara indigenous people, whose village you can see [on Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/7%C2%B018'20.0%22S+65%C2%B015'36.9%22W/@-7.3056605,-65.2618449,743m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d-7.3055556!4d-65.26025?entry=ttu).
- **I'm a big Latin nerd.** In grad school, I took most of my classes in Latin and lived in the *domus Latina* (Latin house), where we spoke only Latin except when we had guestsâ€¦ which, as you might guess, was rare ðŸ˜‚
- **My favorite "just for fun" books** are [*What If?*](https://what-if.xkcd.com/) and [*William Shakespeare's Star Wars*](https://iandoescher.com/william-shakespeares-star-wars/). You can see my current obsessions [on my Reading page](http://localhost:4000/reading/).
