I'm a web developer and Rubyist, originally self-taught from a humanities teaching background.

I'm comfortable across the full stack, building **maintainable and scalable Rails apps** and bringing to life **user-friendly UIs with Hotwire or React**. I also love to learn and stretch myself, as you'll see in my projects below!
