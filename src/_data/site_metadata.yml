# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.metadata.title }}, {{ site.metadata.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.metadata.myvariable }}.
