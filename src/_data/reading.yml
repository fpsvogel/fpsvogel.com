  notes:
  - In my first read-through this was a revelation, as if I'd never known what programming
    means. I didn't get as much out of it on subsequent re-reads.
  - Single Responsibility Principle (Responsibility-Driven Design)
  - call accessors, do NOT use data directly; also hide data structures
  - single responsibility for methods too! this avoids the need for comments
  - dependency injection (move dependencies outside of classes, e.g. external class
    names), or if constrained then isolate dependencies in initialize
  - also encapsulate external messages in separate wrapper methods
  - use keyword arguments w/ defaults (can be messages to self), or if constrained
    then wrap (external) positional methods in a factory (module)
  - 'think about direction of dependency: depend on abstractions/interfaces or classes
    w/ few dependents & not likely to change'
  - use sequence diagrams (UML) to form an intention about a program, to define public
    interfaces (message-based design), before writing first test, before writing classes
  - shift as much as possible into private interfaces (the kitchen vs. the menu);
    in public interfaces focus on the "what" not the "how"; this way, make each class's
    context small; classes shouldn't even know what their dependents do, but should
    just ask them to do their part
  - do not define public/private, just name methods in private interface like _some_private_method
  - to solve Demeter violations, decouple code by improving public interfaces (don't
    chain because it increases knowledge and overspecifies the context), not just
    by delegation with wrappers
  - 'recognize hidden ducks: case statements that switch on class, kind_of?/is_a?,
    responds_to?'
  - when creating a superclass, start blank and promote abstractions (don't start
    w/ existing class and demote concretions)
  - 'template method pattern: def initialize(**opts); @tire_size = opts'
  - ":tire_size ¦¦ default_tire_size"
  - 'but supply an implementation for every message a class sends, like this: def
    default_tire_size; raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} should have implemented
    #{__method__}"; end'
  - set up hooks in the superclass for subclasses to override (don't force subclasses
    to send super at the end of overrides) e.g. post_initialize() and local_spares()
  - composition is more flexible than inheritance/modules, with fewer dependenies
    (see recumbent_config)
  - ruthlessly delete unused code
  - when testing involves roles, use stubs/doubles (fake/idealized objects in a role)
  - prove command messages with mocks
  - to test duck types (roles), include test modules (…InterfaceTest)
  - test inherited code (…InterfaceTest and …SubclassTest)

  - 'The first of Marcus''s ten thinking strategies against anger really hit me: that
    we are naturally social beings designed to help one another, so we should seek
    fellowship with those around us even if it''s a bother. "He adds, ''Nor can I
    be angry with my kinsman nor hate him for we have come into being for co-operation,''
    and that to obstruct one another by feeling resentment or turning our back on
    others goes against our rational and social nature. Indeed, he says that the good
    for a rational creature lies, partly, in having an attitude of fellowship toward
    others. Marcus also goes so far as to claim that ignoring our fellowship with
    others is a form of injustice, a vice, and an impiety because it goes against
    Nature." (cf. Meditations 2.1, 5.16, 9.1)'

  - 'The last four chapters are fantastic, on how to appropriate ANE/biblical cosmology
    for our own use today. After considering fundamentalism as impossible (believing
    this cosmology literally) and divine accommodation as fine as far as it goes,
    he introduces a third way, "the metaphysical and metaphorical truth of myth",
    with these words: "It seems to me that God is communicating his truth not merely
    in spite of the ''wrong science'' but *in and through it*. And, I suggest, God
    can *still* speak truth through these ancient ideas, and while they may not be
    scientifically true, they point to important metaphysical truths that remain as
    true today as they ever were."'
  - So many insights in these last chapters, on how we might (1) untrain our modern
    minds to view the world not as a lifeless machine but as alive and divine, in
    the sense of being grounded in and proceeding from God's being. E.g. when we see
    a mountain, feel that it is a path to ascend to be near to God; when we see a
    thunderstorm, feel that it is a manifestation of God's power; when we see a stone,
    feel that God's aliveness is in it too, and the "life" in it is magnified or diminished
    as we sculpt the stone or break it up and throw it away. All this is not delusion,
    even from a scientific point of view, because science doesn't tell us the ultimate
    cause of the universe, or why natural laws persist from moment to moment.

  blurb: Shows with careful analysis that committed gay marriages are actually not
    prohibited in the Bible. Also, the book's approach of discerning the "moral logic"
    around an issue is invaluable for understanding the Bible as a whole, or any other
    ancient text.
  notes:
  - 'Ch. 8: "In Romans 2:1, “Passing judgment on another” is the sin that is equated
    with the licentiousness, greed, and lust portrayed in 1:18-32. The posture of
    judgmentalism entails essentially the same sin described in the previous chapter.
    But this only raises the further question: What does out-of-control lust have
    in common with judgmentalism? In both cases, what Paul seems to have in mind is
    the attempt to advance one’s own honor, status, and will at the expense of others.
    This interpretation is confirmed by a second piece of evidence found a bit later
    in the passage, in Romans 2:8, where Paul characterizes those who are subject
    to divine judgment as “those who are self-seeking and who obey not the truth but
    wickedness.” The Greek word translated here as “self-seeking” (eritheia) is an
    uncommon word and somewhat difficult to translate. But most interpreters follow
    the lexicon’s suggestion of “selfishness” — or, even better, “selfish ambition.”
    What is at stake here is the thirst for honor, status, and prestige that is so
    prevalent in the ancient world.3 Hence, as Paul sees it, what lustful pagans have
    in common with self-righteous judgmental Christians is that both are driven by
    the thirst for their own agenda — their own way, their own status, their own honor
    — while ignoring the concerns of everyone around them, particularly those of the
    living God. At the root of all sin is the will to power that resists the posture
    of humble gratitude and trust that marks human life as God intends it. Indeed,
    as Robert Jewett has argued in his recent magisterial commentary on Romans, this
    is the discovery that marked Paul’s own conversion: the realization that his zeal
    for the law was in reality selfishly driven by his own longing for status and
    honor. In commenting on Romans 7:7 (“I would not have known what it is to covet
    if the law had not said, ‘You shall not covet’”), Jewett defines the core problem
    driving covetousness as “the sin of asserting oneself and one’s group at the expense
    of others.”"'
  - Lots of other memorable bits. Maybe I'll add them here when I re-read.

  - This is an amazing way of understanding why the Bible has warts. Essentially,
    it's for the same reasons that God chose to be incarnated in Jesus, a carpenter's
    son who was crucified as a criminal.
  - I'm not sure the excursion into Barth was necessary, seeing as how a book like
    this should be as accessible as possible to normal people who are not theology
    nerds but who are turned off by the Bible's imperfections.
  - 'Boyd suggests that the OT Israelites were led by demons at some points when they
    thought they were hearing God: "The fact that Paul instructs us to reject any
    Gospel other than the cross-centered Gospel he preached, even if it be delivered
    by “an angel from heaven” (Gal 1:8). provides further reason for us to conclude
    that Moses was mistaken when he thought he heard Yahweh instruct him to have the
    Israelites mercilessly slaughter “anything that breathes” in certain regions of
    Canaan (Deut 20:16)." and "Although Elijah is generally depicted as a hero of
    the faith in Scripture, and although the fire that fell from the sky was clearly
    supernatural, Jesus rebuked his disciples for wanting to follow Elijah’s example.
    Some early manuscripts add that Jesus suggested that James and John were of a
    “different spirit” than he. If this reading is accepted, as I’m inclined to think
    it should be, Jesus was suggesting that Elijah’s destructive miracle had a demonic
    quality to it."'
  - 'Postscript "Beautiful Scars": putting together a broken vase with the Japanese
    restorative art of Kintsugi: "Moreover, this lady came to see how her masterpiece
    told a particular unique story of hope rising out of hopelessness and beauty rising
    out of brokenness. In fact, she shared that these cracks greatly increased her
    personal connection to her vase because they now had something in common: a story
    of brokenness and restoration. In fact, for her, those beautiful cracks became
    a symbol of her own brokenness and of her need to always trust that God is working
    in her to “turn her ashes into beauty,” as one of her favorite worship songs put
    it. But to appreciate this, my friend had to be willing to let go of her previous
    dream of getting as much of her pre-broken vase back as possible."'

  blurb: The author is a sensitive communicator, so this is a good one to recommend
    to on-the-fence conservatives. The book is also valuable beyond the main issue
    because it demonstrates a deliberative process of interpreting the Bible's commands
    that is rarely acknowledged but often practiced both today (with less controversial
    issues) and in the Bible itself—and not just on the fringes, but in such a way
    that it's at the heart of the gospel.
  notes:
  - A good follow-up is The Bible and Sexuality by the same author
  - 'Ch. 5 (What Is Ethical? Interpreting the Bible like Jesus): Two biblical examples
    of reinterpreting biblical commands for the sake of ethics: (1) lighter rules
    for slaves in Deut. 15:12-18 than in Ex. 21:2-11, (2) exceptions on divorce by
    Paul (1 Cor. 7:12-15) and Matthew (19:9) not given by Jesus (Mark 10:11-12). In
    the second example, Jesus'' command was reinterpreted despite being grounded in
    a creation ordinance. Also, other examples of handling laws with discernment of
    human need: David eating the tabernacle bread (Matt. 12:3-4), Jesus telling his
    accusers that it''s OK to help people in need on the Sabbath (and Sabbath is another
    creation ordinance!).'
  - '"Even though Jesus honored the Sabbath, he was accused of violating it. In response
    to his accusers, he took their objections at face value and taught *the fundamental
    reason* for God’s law, namely, God’s law is made for humankind, not humankind
    for God’s law (Mark 2:27). In other words, God’s ordinances are always *on behalf
    of* people and not for the arbitrary appeasement of God’s sensibilities. For that
    reason, even a creation ordinance requires discernment to be properly interpreted
    and applied. Lest we think such interpretative work was only for the inspired
    biblical authors, Jesus indicates otherwise. His instructions for interpreting
    the Bible were given to ordinary religious leaders of his day (i.e., the faith
    community). He confronted them for failing to adequately engage the deliberative
    process. In other words, the interpretive practices we see Jesus and the biblical
    authors employ are examples given for us to follow. Jesus wanted his accusers
    to learn how to be better readers and appliers of Scripture."'
  - 'Paul too advised discernment about applying Sabbath laws in Col. 2: "do not let
    anyone judge you with respect to food or drink, or in the matter of a feast, new
    moon, or Sabbath days—these are only the shadow of the things to come"—a point
    reiterated in Heb. 10:1 "The law possesses a shadow of the good things to come."'
  - 'Ch. 6: The PCA has engaged in casuistry (development of case law) to add another
    exception to Jesus'' prohibition of divorce, in cases of domestic violence.'
  - 'Ch. 7: Augustine believed intersex people were not a product of the fall: "For
    God is the Creator of all things: He Himself knows where and when anything should
    be, or should have been, created; and He knows how to weave the beauty of the
    whole out of the similarity and diversity of its parts. The man who cannot view
    the whole is offended by what he takes to be the deformity of a part; but this
    is because he does not know how it is to be adapted or related to the whole. …
    God forbid, however, that someone who does not know why the Creator has done what
    He has done should be foolish enough to suppose that God has in such cases erred."'

  - It was a huge relief to learn that it's OK to write only system specs and model
    specs, it's OK if I'm not mocking and stubbing, and it's OK if I'm not always
    doing TDD. Most other testing guides that I've read are depressing because of
    the unattainable purity of their approach or because of the overwhelming amount
    of terminology and tools. But this is a breath of fresh air.

  - Honest and insightful into into the foibles, failings, and glories of humanity.
    It made me laugh and it made me cry.
  - 'The podcast is similar and just as good: https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed'
  - 'It''s hard to pick favorites because so many are good, but here are some highlights:
    Humanity''s Temporal Range, Academic Decathlon, Piggly Wiggly, CNN, Harvey, Googling
    Strangers (made me cry more than I ever have while reading a book), Mortification'
  - John reflects on a perfectly balanced blend of his inner life and the strange
    curiosities of the world out there, connecting them in ways that make me want
    to be more attentive in my own life.
  - Makes me want to write essays, not for the quality of the end product (they wouldn't
    be great) but to bare my soul to the world and in so doing, maybe to revive some
    buried embers in other souls like John Green does.
  - The only downside is that John's anxiety about disease is also contagious. Not
    that I wasn't already anxious about disease, these days…

  blurb: The most satisfying theodicy that I've come across.
  notes:
  - 'Here''s a summary: https://books.google.com/books?id=G0e4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA103'
  - I found this when I was pondering the significance of death in the Christian story
    vs. the material history of the universe. Christians who accept science must admit
    that death and decay are built into the universe and so were there from the beginning,
    contra the traditional story of the fall. For most, this means God intended for
    death to be a natural part of the world. But to me this is unsatisfying, both
    on a gut level and also in how central to Christianity it is to view death as
    a bad thing.
  - 'Boyd''s is a much more spiritually and poetically fulfilling theory for explaining
    the suffering "built into" nature. I couldn''t help recalling Tolkien''s creation
    account in The Silmarillion, because I think it is an amazingly vivid portrayal
    of the same theodicy: https://archive.org/details/TheSilmarillionIllustratedJ.R.R.TolkienTedNasmith/page/n25/mode/2up'
  - But the Silmarillion's creation story, unlike Boyd's take, has classical theist
    overtones in that the gods play the universe into being as a song, and then they
    play the song back as if they are outside of time.

  - 'UPDATE: Originally I gave this a 3, but I''m bumping it up to a 4 after re-reading
    the first several chapters, and after watching videos by Inspiring Philosophy
    that brought some of Walton''s key points into greater focus: https://inspiringphilosophy.org/evolution-and-genesis/
    and https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mr9ZTZb3TUeQHe-lZZF2DTxDHA_LFxi.'
  - 'I *wanted* this to be 4 stars because out of all arguments against Genesis 1
    as describing material creation, this book has the most coherent thesis: that
    Genesis 1 describes functional (not material) origins.'
  - 'But the book has a number of shortcomings: overly academic language, arcane side-discussions,
    too much credit given to Intelligent Design.'
  - Genesis 1 as temple dedication ritual is a fascinating idea.
  - Walton believes that Genesis 1 still refers to a historical 7 days—not when God
    created everything materially, but when he proclaimed the functions of everything.
    I think this is unnecessary and it feels a bit awkward to say that God showed
    up a few billion years after the Big Bang to proclaim all the functions, when
    the universe had been developing quite nicely without the functions having been
    proclaimed. But for people who refuse to abandon the historical 7 days, it is
    an option.
  - 'In an email to Dr. Ball, after he recommended this book: Coincidentally I stumbled
    upon Walton''s book just a few weeks ago and I''m almost done reading it now.
    It is the most convincing explanation of a "non-literal" reading of Genesis 1
    because he explains that the most literal (or "face value") reading does not say
    anything about the material concerns that today''s "literal" readings put front
    and center. While many Christians lament that scientists'' views infect people''s
    faith, it''s funny that Walton turns the tables and points out that "literalist"
    readings are themselves imbued with a modern scientific mindset that has no place
    in understanding what God was saying to the ancient Israelites.'

  - 'There are many more "intermediate forms" in the fossil record than I thought,
    and even some existing today such as walking fish. My other main doubt—how complex
    features could possibly evolve if they aren''t useful in an intermediate stage—was
    also put to rest, because generally these features evolved only if they were useful
    in a half-formed state: for example, those walking fish have fins that have evolved
    into legs because in their environment (shallow water) it helps them escape predators
    by running onto land, or it helps them move from one small body of water to the
    next. Cf. the famous dictum "Evolution is a tinkerer, not an engineer." Even humans
    have very imperfect features that nonetheless work well enough, e.g. knees and
    ankles that are pretty fragile and not great for bipedal locomotion, but they
    usually work. (An ostrich''s legs are much stronger and more resilient.) Similarly,
    our eyes are not nearly as good as some other types of eyes that have independently
    evolved, such as octopus eyes.'
  - 50,000 or 75,000 years ago there was a serious bottleneck in homo sapiens evolution,
    estimated anywhere between 40 and a few thousand mating pairs. This is a more
    severe bottleneck than happens in most species, and for homo sapiens there seem
    to have been other similarly bad bottlenecks.

  - 'The most staggering passage: “The blessing was a mercy. He was offering me the
    same terms of surrender he had offered my sister. I imagined what a relief it
    must have been for her, to realize she could trade her reality—the one she shared
    with me—for his. How grateful she must have felt to pay such a modest price for
    her betrayal. I could not judge her for her choice, but in that moment I knew
    I could not choose it for myself. Everything I had worked for, all my years of
    study, had been to purchase for myself this one privilege: to see and experience
    more truths than those given to me by my father, and to use those truths to construct
    my own mind. I had come to believe that the ability to evaluate many ideas, many
    histories, many points of view, was at the heart of what it means to self-create.
    If I yielded now, I would lose more than an argument. I would lose custody of
    my own mind. This was the price I was being asked to pay, I understood that now.
    What my father wanted to cast from me wasn’t a demon: it was me.”'

    studied so much history (e.g. his youthful antipathy to religion). Favorite quote:
    "Violent revolutions do not so much redistribute wealth as destroy it. There may
    be a redivision of the land, but the natural inequality of men soon recreates
    an inequality of possessions and privileges, and raises to power a new minority
    with essentially the same instincts as in the old. The only real revolution is
    in the enlightenment of the mind and the improvement of character, the only real
    emancipation is individual, and the only real revolutionists are philosophers
    and saints."'

  - The oil industry really has got America by the balls. They've kept the conversation
    focused on recycling (the consumers' responsibility!). Many "chasing arrows" symbols
    (misleadingly) don't mean recyclable—and even when they do mean recyclable, recycling
    centers are able to recycle only the simplest formats like bottles. Oh, and now
    that oil for energy is down, they're ramping up single use plastics even more.
    And America dumps its excess plastic in countries like Indonesia, where it is
    burned or dumped into the ocean. Sigh. In our house I'll make sure we lower our
    plastic consumption… as soon as we have money to do so.

    was an artisan among mercenaries. He strove for transcendance ("purity" as he
    said) in a consumerist world. He would''ve found it better in a field less ephemeral
    than tech. But I guess that''s my story: I tried the humanities but found the
    cost of a making life there too high. So now I''m in tech but aiming at (relatively)
    lasting and meaningful things.'
