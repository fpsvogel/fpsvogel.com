  - 'Ruby examples: https://github.com/davidgf/design-patterns-in-ruby'
  - Strategy (e.g. MergeSort, InsertionSort) vs. Command (e.g. Cut, Copy, Delete)
  - 'State: similar to Strategy, but with a different intent. Example: the changing
    states of a gumball machine.'
  - Pub-Sub is similar to Observer, but it involves a middleman (the message broker
    / event bus) between the publisher and the subscribers, and usually it is implemented
    asynchronously with a message queue.
  - Factory Method (inheritance) vs. Abstract Factory (composition).
  - 'Decorator, Adapter, and Facade are all wrappers but with different purposes.
    Decorator: adds responsibility (and behavior). Adapter: changes the interface.
    Facade: makes an interface simpler, or joins several interfaces into a simpler
    one.'
  - 'Composite: a tree structure where invididual objects (leaves) and compositions
    (nodes) are treated uniformly. Example: a menu with items and submenus.'

  notes:
  - A revelation. It's like I've never known what programming means.
  - Single Responsibility Principle (Responsibility-Driven Design)
  - call accessors, do NOT use data directly; also hide data structures
  - single responsibility for methods too! this avoids the need for comments
  - dependency injection (move dependencies outside of classes, e.g. external class
    names), or if constrained then isolate dependencies in initialize
  - also encapsulate external messages in separate wrapper methods
  - use keyword arguments w/ defaults (can be messages to self), or if constrained
    then wrap (external) positional methods in a factory (module)
  - 'think about direction of dependency: depend on abstractions/interfaces or classes
    w/ few dependents & not likely to change'
  - use sequence diagrams (UML) to form an intention about a program, to define public
    interfaces (message-based design), before writing first test, before writing classes
  - shift as much as possible into private interfaces (the kitchen vs. the menu);
    in public interfaces focus on the "what" not the "how"; this way, make each class's
    context small; classes shouldn't even know what their dependents do, but should
    just ask them to do their part
  - do not define public/private, just name methods in private interface like _some_private_method
  - to solve Demeter violations, decouple code by improving public interfaces (don't
    chain because it increases knowledge and overspecifies the context), not just
    by delegation with wrappers
  - 'recognize hidden ducks: case statements that switch on class, kind_of?/is_a?,
    responds_to?'
  - when creating a superclass, start blank and promote abstractions (don't start
    w/ existing class and demote concretions)
  - 'template method pattern: def initialize(**opts); @tire_size = opts-- :tire_size
    ¦¦ default_tire_size'
  - 'but supply an implementation for every message a class sends, like this: def
    default_tire_size; raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} should have implemented
    #{__method__}"; end'
  - set up hooks in the superclass for subclasses to override (don't force subclasses
    to send super at the end of overrides) e.g. post_initialize() and local_spares()
  - composition is more flexible than inheritance/modules, with fewer dependenies
    (see recumbent_config)
  - ruthlessly delete unused code
  - when testing involves roles, use stubs/doubles (fake/idealized objects in a role)
  - prove command messages with mocks
  - to test duck types (roles), include test modules (…InterfaceTest)
  - test inherited code (…InterfaceTest and …SubclassTest)

  - It was a huge relief to learn that it's OK to write only system specs and model
    specs, it's OK if I'm not mocking and stubbing, and it's OK if I'm not always
    doing TDD. Most other testing guides that I've read are depressing because of
    the unattainable purity of their approach or because of the overwhelming amount
    of terminology and tools. But this is a breath of fresh air.

  - Honest and insightful into into the foibles, failings, and glories of humanity.
    It made me laugh and it made me cry.
  - 'It''s hard to pick favorites because so many are good, but here are some highlights:
    Humanity''s Temporal Range, Academic Decathlon, Piggly Wiggly, CNN, Harvey, Googling
    Strangers (made me cry more than I ever have while reading a book), Mortification'
  - John reflects on a perfectly balanced blend of his inner life and the strange
    curiosities of the world out there, connecting them in ways that make me want
    to be more attentive in my own life.
  - Makes me want to write essays, not for the quality of the end product (they wouldn't
    be great) but to bare my soul to the world and in so doing, maybe to revive some
    buried embers in other souls like John Green does.
  - The only downside is that John's anxiety about disease is also contagious. Not
    that I wasn't already anxious about disease, these days…

  - 'Top insights:'
  - "#1 evolution is not random but DOES have a predictable trajectory based on physical
    laws (a field called structuralism)"
  - "#2 Genesis says that God did NOT create the world perfect because God told the
    humans to subdue the earth (in a military sense)"
  - '#3 the "creation" of humans as God''s election/appointing of already-existing
    humans fits with God''s "creation" of Israel out of already-existing people and
    "create in me a clean heart" etc.'
  - "#4 physical death being built into nature from the beginning is not a new belief
    (Basil, Aquinas, Calvin) and avoids young-earth creationist nonsense like the
    denial that plants are alive, cf. https://biologos.org/common-questions/did-death-occur-before-the-fall/,

  - 'But I still find it hard to accept that physical death and decay were intended
    by God non-humans—animals, plants, and nonbiological bodies like stars. A better
    approach is the one taken by Gregory Boyd, for example in his paper "Evolution
    as Cosmic Warfare": https://books.google.com/books?id=gwpMAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA125. Here''s
    a summary: https://books.google.com/books?id=G0e4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA103. This is a
    much more spiritually and poetically fulfilling theory for explaining the suffering
    "built into" nature. I couldn''t help recalling Tolkien''s creation account in

  - 'UPDATE: Originally I gave this a 3, but I''m bumping it up to a 4 after re-reading
    the first several chapters, and after watching videos by Inspiring Philosophy
    that brought some of Walton''s key points into greater focus: https://inspiringphilosophy.org/evolution-and-genesis/
    and https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mr9ZTZb3TUeQHe-lZZF2DTxDHA_LFxi.'
  - 'I *wanted* this to be 4 stars because out of all arguments against Genesis 1
    as describing material creation, this book has the most coherent thesis: that
    Genesis 1 describes functional (not material) origins.'
  - 'But the book has a number of shortcomings: overly academic language, arcane side-discussions,
    too much credit given to Intelligent Design.'
  - Genesis 1 as temple dedication ritual is a fascinating idea.
  - Walton believes that Genesis 1 still refers to a historical 7 days—not when God
    created everything materially, but when he proclaimed the functions of everything.
    I think this is unnecessary and it feels a bit awkward to say that God showed
    up a few billion years after the Big Bang to proclaim all the functions, when
    the universe had been developing quite nicely without the functions having been
    proclaimed. But for people who refuse to abandon the historical 7 days, it is
    an option.
  - 'In an email to Dr. Ball, after he recommended this book: Coincidentally I stumbled
    upon Walton''s book just a few weeks ago and I''m almost done reading it now.
    It is the most convincing explanation of a "non-literal" reading of Genesis 1
    because he explains that the most literal (or "face value") reading does not say
    anything about the material concerns that today''s "literal" readings put front
    and center. While many Christians lament that scientists'' views infect people''s
    faith, it''s funny that Walton turns the tables and points out that "literalist"
    readings are themselves imbued with a modern scientific mindset that has no place
    in understanding what God was saying to the ancient Israelites.'

  - 'There are many more "intermediate forms" in the fossil record than I thought,
    and even some existing today such as walking fish. My other main doubt—how complex
    features could possibly evolve if they aren''t useful in an intermediate stage—was
    also put to rest, because generally these features evolved only if they were useful
    in a half-formed state: for example, those walking fish have fins that have evolved
    into legs because in their environment (shallow water) it helps them escape predators
    by running onto land, or it helps them move from one small body of water to the
    next. Cf. the famous dictum "Evolution is a tinkerer, not an engineer." Even humans
    have very imperfect features that nonetheless work well enough, e.g. knees and
    ankles that are pretty fragile and not great for bipedal locomotion, but they
    usually work. (An ostrich''s legs are much stronger and more resilient.) Similarly,
    our eyes are not nearly as good as some other types of eyes that have independently
    evolved, such as octopus eyes.'
  - 50,000 or 75,000 years ago there was a serious bottleneck in homo sapiens evolution,
    estimated anywhere between 40 and a few thousand mating pairs. This is a more
    severe bottleneck than happens in most species, and for homo sapiens there seem
    to have been other similarly bad bottlenecks.

  - About a quarter of the way in, it's already become a monotonous string of anecdotes
    of twisted men heaping abuse upon women and children.
  - It gets better halfway in, when she starts at BYU.
  - Finished. I have no words. This shook me to my core. How many Christians are playing
    out that same insane ritual of in-group loyalty oblivious to Christ's love? Is
    this why LGBT people are excluded?
  - 'The most staggering passage: “The blessing was a mercy. He was offering me the
    same terms of surrender he had offered my sister. I imagined what a relief it
    must have been for her, to realize she could trade her reality—the one she shared
    with me—for his. How grateful she must have felt to pay such a modest price for
    her betrayal. I could not judge her for her choice, but in that moment I knew
    I could not choose it for myself. Everything I had worked for, all my years of
    study, had been to purchase for myself this one privilege: to see and experience
    more truths than those given to me by my father, and to use those truths to construct
    my own mind. I had come to believe that the ability to evaluate many ideas, many
    histories, many points of view, was at the heart of what it means to self-create.
    If I yielded now, I would lose more than an argument. I would lose custody of
    my own mind. This was the price I was being asked to pay, I understood that now.
    What my father wanted to cast from me wasn’t a demon: it was me.”'

  - Fritz Haber - what a dramatic and tragic life, like a modern Oedipus.
  - Sometimes we are TOO cautious, or rather too gullible of unproved suspicions of
    certain inventions, e.g. DDT, GMOs, and BPA are all benign, and in the former
    two actually better than the alternatives (worse pesticides, expensive and harmful
    antimalarials). Also prostate and breast cancer screening don't help and only
    lead to harm.

    And I respect his willingness to say he was wrong when he was younger and hadn''t
    studied so much history (e.g. his youthful antipathy to religion). Favorite quote:
    "Violent revolutions do not so much redistribute wealth as destroy it. There may
    be a redivision of the land, but the natural inequality of men soon recreates
    an inequality of possessions and privileges, and raises to power a new minority
    with essentially the same instincts as in the old. The only real revolution is
    in the enlightenment of the mind and the improvement of character, the only real
    emancipation is individual, and the only real revolutionists are philosophers
    and saints."'

  - The oil industry really has got America by the balls. They've kept the conversation
    focused on recycling (the consumers' responsibility!). Many "chasing arrows" symbols
    (misleadingly) don't mean recyclable—and even when they do mean recyclable, recycling
    centers are able to recycle only the simplest formats like bottles. Oh, and now
    that oil for energy is down, they're ramping up single use plastics even more.
    And America dumps its excess plastic in countries like Indonesia, where it is
    burned or dumped into the ocean. Sigh. In our house I'll make sure we lower our
    plastic consumption… as soon as we have money to do so.
