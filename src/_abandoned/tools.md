Time-saving tools that are so awesome that they get an entire page of their own.

## Reading

- **Library Extension** ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/library-extension/chkgcmmjoejpekoegkedcpifgfhpjmec), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/libraryextension/)) shows you at a glance where to find a book in local and digital libraries. It makes reading for free so easy.
- **Goodreads ratings for Amazon** ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodreads-ratings-for-ama/fkkcefhhadenobhjnngfdahhlodolkjg), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/goodreads-ratings-for-amazon/)) gives you a shortcut to Goodreads from Amazon book pages. Because Goodreads reviews are generally more informative.

## Desktop

Some of these are for Windows only, but you can find MacOS and Linux alternatives.

- **Clipboard manager:** [Ditto](https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/). I can't tell you how great it is to have a near-infinite clipboard.
- **Text expander:** [Beeftext](https://beeftext.org/). Great for code snippets, often-used phrases for emails, and emojis. üëç
- **Keyboard and mouse macros:** [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). Like a Swiss army knife with a million thingamabobs. [Here's how I used AutoHotkey](/posts/2020/autohotkey) to make my keyboard and mouse significantly more useful, but [now I type on a Keyboardio Atreus](/posts/2021/keyboardio-atreus) and it is even better.

## Web browser

- **Keyboard web navigation:** [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb) for Chrome, [VimiumFF](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/) for Firefox turns the Web into a keyboard-navigable land of magic. See the [readme](https://github.com/philc/vimium/blob/master/README.md) to get started. You'll want to customize the key mappings, unless you're one of those cool people who use Vim. In which case you probably don't need this extension because you browse the web in your terminal.
- **OpenList** ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/openlist/nkpjembldfckmdchbdiclhfedcngbgnl), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/openlist/)) allows you to open a list of URLs, or copy a list of URLs from your open tabs.
- [**Open Last Tab**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-last-tab/naolnccddjabbhmjogiejjgocjnglmge) for Chrome or [**Cycle Last Used Tabs**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clut-cycle-last-used-tabs/) for Firefox makes it easier to jump between tabs.
