title: Reflections on RubyConf 2024
subtitle: the Ruby community is loving
description: At RubyConf 2024 I was impressed by the call to love each other. If we make space to help others, "Matz is nice and so we are nice" (MINASWAN) is true as ever.

Last month I attended RubyConf 2024 in Chicago. The keynote talks were a highlight for me. Several of them had a common theme that I've been reflecting on: **in the Ruby community, we are defined by our love for each other**.

Earlier this year [I wrote about](/posts/2024/railsconf-2024-recap-ruby-community) how I went to RailsConf at a time when I was tired and somewhat burnt out, and even so it was a delightful experience because of how welcoming and inclusive I found the community to be.

Now I'm thinking about how this community is also **loving**. Maybe that's the same thing as welcoming and inclusive, but the way I heard it this time around was **challenging and even unsettling**. I'll explain below, but first, what about the keynote talks got me thinking about this?

## Love each other

One of the highlights of RubyConf was that, for the first time since 2019, Matz and several other Ruby core team members from Japan attended.

A clear theme of Matz's keynote talk was that **our love for each other** is what makes the Ruby community special.

Another keynote talk was about *our humanity*, how we should be wise in our use of AI tools, and how we shouldn't forget to hire early-career developers and help them grow.

Yet another keynote was about *helping each other* in challenging situations.

Is it just me, or were these talks reiterating a similar message?

## Re-centering

None of this is new: being kind has always been a (maybe *the*) value of the Ruby community. The motto "Matz is nice and so we are nice" (MINASWAN) came up at least once every day of the conference, but I'd heard it many times before.

And yetâ€¦ I felt such an *emphasis*, especially with Matz's phrasing of it: ***love each other***.

It made me think about how I could help others more in my professional sphere:

- **Help out a coworker who's struggling** even when it happens not to be very "visible" work ðŸ«¥
- **Talk with a stranger who is desperate to find a job**â€”there are a lot of them, these days ðŸ˜«
- **Mentor others.** I volunteer a little bit on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/), and I maintain my ["Learn Ruby"](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby) list of resources, but maybe I could do more. I've just applied to [First Ruby Friend](https://firstrubyfriend.org/) as a mentor, so we'll see.
- **Contribute to an open-source project that you believe in.** Or just something that you use often and feel like you should give back to. For me that's [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/), which gives me a lot of joy and happens to have [a lot of open "good first issues"](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

Who are the people in *your* life that you could pay more attention to, even when there seems to be no tangible reward?

## Where "love each other" gets unsettling

This is the part where it gets personal and maybe not so inspiring, so feel free to skip down to the next section for an interesting look at *Matz's* personal background. Or click away and go about your day inspired to help other people. Here, have a cute cat picture on your way out.

So.

That list up there of things I could do to help others more. Those things are definitely more selfless than the alternative of telling myself I'm too busy and then going back to work trying to impress the right people in order to get a promotion.

However.

For me these days, there's yet another alternative. I have a toddler, a spouse with baby #2 on the way, and other family around me. When I hear "Love each other," *they* are the ones I think of. There's not much "extra" I can do in my professional life, before it starts eating away at time with familyâ€”or sleep, which is already hit or miss. Because right now, my family needs almost all of my time outside of work.

But stillâ€¦ without piling on a bunch of "extra", could I still be more intentional about helping others as a developer?

Lately I've been ruthlessly simplifying my days by cutting out everything that isn't *absolutely* important to me. I even have a list (written down!) of *"things to do later in life when I have time"*.

So, in my hyper-focused state of mind, I went to RubyConf thinking of it as "coworker hangout time" and not much more, because it was my employer [Kin Insurance](https://www.kin.com/) that paid for me and some coworkers to go, and because it's a remote job that I started just this year, so I had never met any of my coworkers in person.

I spent most lunches and dinners with coworkers, as well as much of the "hallway track" and time between talks. That focus made for a very *different* experience than previously at RailsConf, where my approach was to meet and talk with as many people as I could. Granted, I did still talk to strangers this time, but I wasn't exactly looking out for people who might need someone to talk to.

Maybe I'm being too harsh on myself. It is a busy time of life, after all, and family *should* come firstâ€”this includes providing for them, which means doing what I need to do at work. But is my motivation *really* as selfless as that?

That's why I said the call to *love each other* is unsettling and makes me think about all of my competing priorities, and the tangled web behind what drives me. (The mixed metaphor seems apt here.) *Who am I*, anyway? What do I want, and why? â€¦ cue [Uncle Iroh's speech](https://youtu.be/LeLbwmVFt_g?t=66).

Soâ€¦ that's it. If that's an unsatisfying ending to a conference recap post, sorry. I did warn you. And I gave you a cute cat picture. And if that wasn't enough, then here, enjoy a little story about Matz and some photos.

## Postscript: Matz on humility

This theme of love reminded me of Chapter 17 of [*Coderspeak*](https://uclpress.co.uk/book/coderspeak/), a book of distilled interviews with several Ruby community members.

That entire chapter is great *(and the book is [free to download as a PDF](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10188850/1/Coderspeak.pdf)!)* as it goes into Matz's childhood love of computers and his thoughts on static typing in Ruby.

But here I'll quote the part about how Matz's church (LDS, a.k.a Mormon) influences his leadership in the Ruby community:

> Technology and religion are not topics that usually go together, and I was surprised to hear a major computer scientist talk about his beliefs in a Supreme Being. Matz was frank and honest. It was clear to me, at that moment, that religion might be one of the reasons why Rubyists describe Matz as "nice". I wondered how much of his religious background influenced his view of the community.
>
> "My religion has its own community," he told me. "We have congregations and church members, all with very different backgrounds. Like the Ruby community, we sometimes see conflicts and misunderstandings. Both have complex relationships, even though people try to be good. That's a similarity between them, and I've learned a lot from the religious community on how to handle that."
>
> "I spend most of my time as a programmer," Matz went on. "I talk to technology people, I work with computers, and with the people behind the computer. In the Ruby community, I'm the kind of leader. I have a position that I can say whatever I want to. I'm in a strong position in the community. But in the religious community, they don't care about that. They don't care about me being the leader of the other community. No. I'm just a normal member. And that humbles me. Sometimes a member of the Ruby community admires me, and I understand that I'm a very important person in the Ruby community. However, I'm also a mere human. Being a mere human is a kind of an important balance to me. That kind of balance is pretty important, to act as a good member of the community, so that I can avoid being a dictator."
>
> Matz explained to me that his congregation had influenced him to try and be a good person, a good leader, a good member of the community. And that behaviour results from the difference in how he is positioned within each community. He is the leader of one; he is nothing but a member of the other.

This wouldn't be a conference recap post without at least a couple of photos!
