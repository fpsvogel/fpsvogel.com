Today, a very different topic: **solo tabletop role-playing games** (a.k.a. TTRPGs). Normally I write about programming here, but recently with the arrival of my first baby, this blog is suddenly ~~unfocused~~ *diverse and fun*. But seriously, I wanted to write about solo RPGs because they're helping me become **more creative** and **less paralyzed by perfectionism**.

## How I discovered solo TTRPGs

I enjoy *reading* fiction, but I feel like I'm terrible at *making* it. And since making up silly stories on the fly is a handy skill for a parent, I thought it was a perfect time to confront my creative inhibitions.

But how should I start, if it's those very inhibitions that make any kind of practice routine impossible? It only takes a minute of staring at a blank page (or, worse, the beginning of a story I've written) for me to lose my enthusiasm and run to a more familiar pastime, by which I mean coding.

And yet… once you've realized your #1 hobby is *the same thing that you do all day at work*, and you contemplate the fact that your kid might not end up sharing that interest (at least in the next, let's say, ten years), you become highly motivated to put your eggs in more baskets, as the saying goes.

So, how to make creative writing more approachable? I wondered if **making it into a game** might help.

I recalled the handful of *Dungeons & Dragons* sessions that I played a few years ago. *That* was a story-making game, sort of. There was too much *standing around trading blows with trolls* for my taste, but I enjoyed other moments when I was working together with my friends to tell a story within a game.

Questions flooded into my brain:

- *Is there a more narrative-focused TTRPG?*
- *All the TTRPG groups in my area are for D&D… could I instead play solo, just for the storytelling and creative writing practice?*
- *Am I crazy for wanting to try this?*

As it turns out, **yes** and **yes** and **probably not**!

After an epic journey of discovery, which started at [/r/Solo_Roleplaying](https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying), I now present to you my findings on solo TTRPGs.

Note that the titles I mention here are not the *most popular* TTRPGs, just the ones that I myself find most interesting. A few minutes perusing the subreddit will tell you which ones are most popular. (Or I could just tell you that it's [*Ironsworn*](https://www.ironswornrpg.com).)

And if you want a high-level overview, watch ["A Beginner's Guide to Solo Role Playing (solo RPGs)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYHt1pdScK0).

## My favorite TTRPG

My favorite find is [*ALONe*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/168609) with *The GameMaster's Apprentice (GMA)* ([online]((https://jamesturneronline.net/game-masters-apprentice)) or [physical cards](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/125685/The-GameMasters-Apprentice-Base-Deck)) and [*GMA Adventure Guide Pack*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/179835).

I like *ALONe* for several reasons:

- It's focused on **narrative** rather than the minutiae of combat.
- It's **freeform**. It works for any setting, rather than being limited by a particular system of stats and skills.
- It's **simple**.
- It's **all-in-one** thanks to the *GMA* cards. Solo role-playing can be a bit cumbersome to a newcomer, in that it involves referencing tables to generate or inspire content. Not so with this one!

Other narrative-focused TTRPGs that I found interesting are [*Freeform Universal*](https://www.perilplanet.com/freeform-universal) (especially the [2nd edition beta](https://www.perilplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Neon-City-character-sheet-form-fill.pdf)), and [*Risus*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/170294/Risus-The-Anything-RPG) plus the [*Risusverse*](https://www.risusiverse.com/).

But neither of these is *designed* for solo play, so you'd have to supplement them with solo resources (more on that below). For me, *ALONe* wins because it's a complete and elegant package.

## Honorable mentions

Here are some other TTRPGs that I've bookmarked for later:

- [*Pendragon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendragon_(role-playing_game)) is very *crunchy* (as the more numbers-heavy games are described), but I just can't resist its detailed literary-historical setting.
- *Dungeon Hero* ([Vol. 1](https://lonespelunker.itch.io/dungeon-hero), [Vol. 2](https://lonespelunker.itch.io/dungeon-hero-volume-2), [Vol. 3](https://lonespelunker.itch.io/dungeon-hero-volume-3-bump-in-the-night)) and its successor [*Welcome Aboard, Captain*](https://lonespelunker.itch.io/welcome-aboard-captain) are two other games designed for solo play, these even simpler than *ALONe* and more game-like.
- [*The Storymaster's Tales*](https://www.storymasterstales.com) is a good option for introducing kids to TTRPGs.
- [*Alone among the Stars*](https://noroadhome.itch.io/alone-among-the-stars) (or [an online version](https://adnroy.itch.io/alone-among-the-stars-twine-version)) and [*Thousand Year Old Vampire*](https://thousandyearoldvampire.com/products/thousand-year-old-vampire-pdf-only) are popular *journaling games*, which are closer to pure creative writing practice, and tied to a specific theme or setting.
- [*Microscope*](https://www.lamemage.com/microscope) as a world-building tool. Solo resources for it:

- Other worldbuilding games: [*Mappa Imperium*](https://nookrium.itch.io/mappa-imperium), [*Artefact*](https://mouseholepress.itch.io/artefact) (try it alongside [*The Kleptogoblicon*](https://perchance.org/kleptogoblicon)), [*DELVE*](https://www.blackwellwriter.com/en-us/products/delve-a-solo-map-drawing-game)/[*UMBRA*](https://www.blackwellwriter.com/en-us/products/umbra-a-game-of-final-frontiers), [*Stars without Number*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/230009/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition-Free-Version) (has a worldbuilding element).

## Solo role-playing tools

As I said, my favorite *ALONe* provides everything needed for solo play and that's why it's my favorite so far, but later on I may want to branch out and explore these other tools.

## Did it work? We shall see…

I'll add an update here or write a sequel post a few months from now, when I've had a chance to see, in the long run, whether solo TTRPGs really do help me in my quest for creative freedom. The worst-case scenario is that they'll become yet another form of practice that didn't stick, but at least I'll have given it a try. And who knows? Maybe you, dear reader, will be inspired to give it a try too.
