I'm looking for my first Rails job. The [dreaded technical interview](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/tech-hiring-has-always-been-broken-heres-how-i-survived-it-for-decades-b7ac33088de6) seems to be rare in the Ruby world, but even for saner interviews it helps to be prepared. So here's what I'm reading (in some cases, re-reading) to shore up my Ruby knowledge this month. (If you're just starting out, see [my study plan](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby-and-cs) for a full guide to the Ruby and Rails resources that have helped me most, including lots of free books and courses.)

- **Testing:** [Jason Swett - The Complete Guide to Rails Testing](https://www.codewithjason.com/complete-guide-to-rails-testing/)
- **Code smells and design patterns:**
  - [Thoughtbot - Ruby Science](https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science) *(free)*
  - [Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/) *(free)*
  - [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/)
- **OOP:** [Sandi Metz - Practical Object-Oriented Design: An Agile Primer Using Ruby](https://www.poodr.com)
- **Ruby and Rails:**
  - [The Well-Grounded Rubyist](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist-third-edition)
  - [Ruby Interview Questions](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.ydns.chernish2) and [Rails Interview Questions](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.ydns.chernish2.rails_free) *(free Android apps)*
  - [Full Stack Ruby on Rails at The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails) *(free)* â€” this is a long one, so I don't expect to finish it this month.

If you're wondering why I've omitted [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com), it's because I prefer building real apps. That way, not only do I grapple with more realistic problems, but also I have an app to show off in the end. Plus, as this is my first focused effort to improve my Rails testing, it's a good opportunity to spin up a new app using good testing pratices from the start. More on that in the next post!
