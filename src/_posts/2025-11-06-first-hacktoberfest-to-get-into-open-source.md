Until last month, I was a Hacktoberfest skeptic. Then, I did Hacktoberfest for the first time.

In past years, I stayed away from it because I didn't see value (either for me or for maintainers) in contributing a few PRs to projects that I may never think about again once the month was over.

But this year, I took a completely different approach: I used the month to **form a habit** of open-source contributing.

## How to start a habit with Hacktoberfest

1. I looked through [participating Ruby-based projects](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest?l=ruby) that have lots of issues labeled "good first issue", until I found one that I care about and use every day: [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs).

2. Rather than a hit-and-run of contributing 6 PRs and then vanishing forever, I used the month to onboard myself as a potential long-term contributor. After all, I've been looking to learn from open-source projects, and what better way than by contributing to a project over the long term? Then I can gain more familiarity and see the project grow over time.

3. Critics of Hacktoberfest say it encourages low-quality PRs, so I made sure to put the same level of effort into my Lobsters PRs as I do at work, which means:
- Documenting significant decisions
- Showing UI changes in screenshots or videos
- Explaining how I manually tested/verified the changes (in addition to adding automated tests when appropriate)

This level of thoroughness may feel like a drag to some people, and I admit it's a chore to take [30 screenshots for a single PR](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/pull/1737) (do I have OCD?). But I like to "show my work" because it helps me catch mistakes, and it gives me—and the PR reviewer—confidence in the quality of my work.

I also enjoyed interacting with Lobsters' incredibly welcoming and responsive maintainer, [pushcx](https://push.cx/), who gave thoughtful feedback not only on my PRs but also during his [livestreamed office hours](https://push.cx/stream). The warmth of these interactions is definitely a draw to keep contributing more.

In November I want to catch up on other things, so I’ll aim for just one or two Lobsters PRs. It may not sound like much, but over a year's time that's several Hacktoberfests!

## Becoming a Bridgetown Core Team member

I've also been contributing to [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/), a Ruby web framework and site generator. My Bridgetown PRs didn't count toward Hacktoberfest, but they were part of my larger effort to become more involved in open source.

Bridgetown is a project that's close to my heart. I used it to build this blog (the one you're looking at) and other personal projects. Over the years I've contributed PRs here and there, but my bigger contribution was to enthusiastically promote the project via blog posts, on social media, and even in my only podcast interview ever, where the hosts apparently (as I found out during recording) thought I was one of the Bridgetown maintainers 😅

So I'm pleased as a peach that as of a few weeks ago, [I'm a member of the Bridgetown Core Team](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/news/welcome-felipe-vogel-to-our-core-team/)! 🎉 This means I'll be contributing more PRs and hanging around the Discord server to answer questions.

## Conclusion: open source vs. other forms of practice

This all sounds like a lot of work. Is it worthwhile?

To answer that, I'll mention some other ways I could have been spending time improving my skills:

- **Coding challenges**, which [I recently wrote about](/posts/2025/types-of-coding-challenges).
- **Learning a new language and/or framework**, either mind-expanding ([Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/)) or job-opportunity-expanding (Python/Java/C#).
- **Computer science and low-level programming**, which [I've made a list about](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-cs).
- **Building a text-based world simulator**, providing lots of opportunities for complex system design that I've [only begun](http://localhost:4000/posts/2023/ruby-text-based-game-real-time-input) to explore.

I'd like to do all of the above sometime or another. But right now, in the current cutthroat job market, open source has a few advantages. With open source, I am:

- expanding my network
- adding more lines to my resume (yeah, sue me)
- showing the quality of my day-to-day work very concretely
- solving problems alongside much more experienced developers, which is a kind of mentorship that I don't often get at work these days

Sure, there are other employability-boosting pastimes. If I build a thing that becomes very popular and I become Internet famous, that's the best thing of all for my resume. If I ever figure out how to do *that* in a month, I'll write a blog post about it.

## A sappy postscript about poop on my new shirt

![my new Hacktoberfest T-shirt with a baby poop stain](/images/hacktoberfest-shirt-with-poop-stain.jpg)

This is my Hacktoberfest shirt that I got in the mail at the end of the month.

The yellow spot is a poop stain that appeared within the first hour of me wearing the shirt, because I was holding my baby.

This picture is so emblematic of my life right now as a parent.

One reason I've had so much time for open source is that every night, I'm holding the baby for an hour or two, bouncing him on the yoga ball, while mom carries out the much more onerous task of putting our night-owl toddler to bed.

The baby is sleeping on my arm for most of that time, so with my other hand I've been able to code and write up PRs. On some nights that's what I *had* to do in order to stay awake,[¹](#footnotes) because anything less active would've made me succumb to my sleep deprivation.

This baby is an early bird, so on some nights I'm up a few hours later, before sunrise, doing the same thing. And on other nights, like tonight, I'm also awake sometime in between. It's [currently 2 a.m.](https://github.com/fpsvogel/fpsvogel.com/commits/main/?since=2025-11-06&until=2025-11-06) when I'm writing this (one-handed). Hence the sleep deprivation.

But you know what? **I love that poop stain.** I smiled when I first noticed it. Being a parent does weird things to you like that.

(I may be able to get it out. My stain-removal-fu is pretty darn good by now. But if not, the yellow spot will just bring me more smiles. A white shirt is doomed from the start anyway, with kids.)

<summary>1. Occasionally, there's <em>nothing</em> I can do to stay awake.</summary>
So I make futile attempts to set the baby down to sleep on his own, so that I can sleep nearby. This invariably fails, and I'm soon back on the yoga ball soothing the baby back to sleep.

<details>
<summary>On nights when the toddler won't sleep except with mom,</summary>
these doomed bids for sleep go on for hours in a loop, almost like a compressed nightmare version of Groundhog Day.

<summary>These nested <code>details</code> (detailses?) are rad.</summary>
They remind me of <a href="https://riki.house">a previous version of the blog riki's house</a>, or the browser game/toy <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/nested">Nested</a>.

This is a pretty weird rabbit hole.

<details>
<summary>At least now you know this post was not written by AI.</summary>

Looking out the window, you notice that an area of grass is dead and blackened, with a hole in the middle of it.

🐇 You find a rabbit! It was just a rabbit hole after all.

Nothing happens, until later in the day, you stub your toe so hard that you die a horrific death.
