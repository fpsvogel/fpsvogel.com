Last year I posted [tips for making a Mac behave more like a PC](/posts/2022/switching-from-pc-windows-to-macos), after having to make the switch for a new job. Since then I've found a bevy of new tools to make my Mac *even more* PC-like.

For all of the incurable PC users out there, I hope this post gives you some hope in the land of Apple.

## Lessons from my switch to Linux

Before we get into Mac-specific tools: earlier this year I replaced Windows with Linux on my PC, and a lot of the lessons I learned there are equally applicable to MacOS:

- [Customize Zsh to get a lovely terminal.](/posts/2023/switch-to-linux-from-windows#payoff-1-a-lovely-terminal)
- [My tricks for staying on the keyboard](/posts/2023/switch-to-linux-from-windows#payoff-2-more-time-spent-on-the-keyboard-less-on-the-mouse) are also mostly applicable.

## MacOS apps for more PC-ification

These are in addition to the apps and hacks I recommended [in last year's post](/posts/2022/switching-from-pc-windows-to-macos), which for the most part I still use.

- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) for window snapping.
- [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai) is the only way I could solve the problem of MacOS keyboard shortcuts that I don't use, can't be customized, and conflict with useful app shortcuts, such as <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> (`Hide window` in MacOS, `History` in Firefox). With BetterTouchTool, I can remap these to "No Action", so that they're usable in apps.
  - BetterTouchTool is a great shortcut app in general, too. For me it has completely replaced Keyboard Maestro, which I used last year.
- [Espanso](https://espanso.org) too has replaced Keyboard Maestro in the other way I used itâ€”for snippets. Espanso is cross-platform, so I can effortlessly keep my snippets in sync between my Mac and my PC.
- [Logi Options+](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/software/logi-options-plus.html) (for my recently-acquired [Logitech MX Master 3s](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s.html)) has replaced SteerMouse for customizing mouse speed and scrolling.

## Conclusion: joy using my (non-)Mac

All this may seem silly to those of you who are thinking, ***"Just give it up and learn how to use a Mac already!"***

This would be a fair point, ***if*** I were committed to using *only* a Mac for the foreseeable future. But the thing is, I still use my PC outside of work, and I don't want to drop $2500 for a personal MacBook Pro that (for my purposes) would be equivalent to my PC.

In fact, I want to *avoid* getting locked into the Apple ecosystem, for a variety of practical and philosophical reasons that boil down to ***freedom***. I don't want my productivity and happiness on a computer to be hostage to a particular corporation and the way *they* think I should use my computer.

Obviously I don't *have* to do things The Apple Way, thanks to the tools I use to PC-ify my Mac. But this has cost considerable time and effort. (To be fair, it also takes effort to get certain things working in Linux that are no problem on my Mac, but somehow I enjoy that sort of tinkering better.)

Still, I'm glad I got to try out a Mac. When the opportunity arises to switch back to a PC for work, I'll do so with full knowledge, and with a renewed appreciation for the freedom that makes the PC world, for all its faults, a more interesting place for me.
