It's been exactly one year since I started studying part-time to get into software development, and I thought it would be useful to write out my curriculum. I am learning Ruby, Rails, and a healthy dose of computer science. I'm also putting this [on GitHub](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby-and-cs) where I will continue to update it, but below is my progress as of now.

## Objections

*Why Ruby?? Isn't JavaScript the obvious choice for web development?* Ruby is a good first language to master because its ecosystem is stable, the community is more experienced, and for me Ruby is more enjoyable to write. Not convinced? [Read this](https://medium.com/learn-love-code/why-teach-ruby-bac8416c77ba) or [watch this](https://youtu.be/IlVfHG-pAag?t=1534).

*OK, but why so many books and courses?? Isn't practice more important than reading?* Yes, you should be spending more time coding than reading, but starting a project and getting into a coding routine is easy, whereas knowing what to read is not at all obvious at the beginning. Hence the larger space devoted to books and courses here. Besides the obvious reasons to undertake serious study (to learn from the masters, and to spice up my resume), I also simply enjoy knowing how things work under the hood.

## Preliminaries

- If you've never written a line of code in your life, you may want to start with the free [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). I studied some computer science in high school, so I had a bit of a head start.
- If you are a working adult, make sure your day job is conducive to part-time studying. Last year I was a first-year schoolteacher. That meant hours of grading in the evenings and on weekends, which would have made studying impossible. For this and other reasons I switched to a remote tech support job, which freed up my evenings and weekends (and early mornings, with no commute).
- Find a system for keeping *organized* notes, code snippets, and articles/videos saved for later. I use a simple text file ([similar to this](https://illdoitlater.xyz/t/plaintext)), which is more effortless than any knowledge base app that I've tried.
- It's worth dipping into the Ruby and wider programming communities. Here are my favorites:
  - [Hacker Newsletter](https://hackernewsletter.com/)
  - [DEV newsletter](https://dev.to/t/newsletter)
  - Ruby: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby), [Discord](https://discord.gg/tSFdeuVfpc), [Slack](https://www.rubyonrails.link/)
  - Rails: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/AuDNwjsyfm)
  - others on Discord: [Bridgetown](https://discord.gg/Cugms94QFM), [StimulusReflex](https://discord.com/invite/stimulus-reflex)
- Last but not least, take care of yourself! Studying (especially while working) can easily be overdone. Exercise and get plenty of sleep. If you develop wrist pain from computer use, act swiftly: get an ergonomic mouse and keyboard, do daily RSI stretches, and start using a break app such as [Workrave](https://workrave.org/).

So without further ado, here are my recommendations from what I studied. Resources that are free of charge are marked with a star (‚≠ê). If you need more free resources, see the links to other lists at the bottom. You may be able to find the books for free (from your local library or more dubious sources) but be sure to buy them when you can, to support the authors. üôÇ

I have often seen this recommended, but its exact subject matter (and whether reading it amounts to anything more than a badge of honor) so far eludes me. Which, I'm sure some would retort, only shows how small my mind still is at this point.
