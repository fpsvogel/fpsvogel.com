## Future plans

I thought about continuing further with the Wiki Stumble app, adding user accounts and authentication. But I think minimalism suits this particular app.

So I'll come up with a new project to learn other tools that I didn't yet get a chance to explore:
  - [Sequel](https://sequel.jeremyevans.net/) as an alternative to Active Record.
  - [ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org/) or [Phlex](https://www.phlex.fun/) to organize view-related code.
  - Turbo enhancements by the StimulusReflex team: [Turbo Boost Commands](https://hopsoft.io/@turbo-boost/commands), [Turbo Boost Streams](https://hopsoft.io/@turbo-boost/streams), and [TurboPower](https://github.com/marcoroth/turbo_power).

In the meantime, I wish you happy Wikipedia-surfing!
