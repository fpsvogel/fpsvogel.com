To many developers, "coding challenge" evokes technical interview trauma.

But there are many kinds of coding challenges, not all of them dehumanizing. I've been making a list of of them over the past few years as I ran into new ones by happenstance, and I thought it would be fun to categorize them.

Language-specific examples are mostly for Ruby, JavaScript, and TypeScript, since those are what I'm most familiar with.

## Some types of coding challenges

### Algorithms / interview prep

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and many more that are easy to find by looking up "DSA practice" or similar.

For LeetCode in particular, there are [many guides and problem sets](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-cs/tree/9759c4531cffadada0b9658f6ee958196879f3b6#leetcode) to help you learn different types of problems.

### Holiday competitions

- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
- [Everybody Codes](https://everybody.codes)
- [Advent of JS](https://www.adventofjs.com)
- [Advent of SQL](https://adventofsql.com)

### Miscellaneous challenges outside the holiday season

## Other activities that are not exactly coding challenges

In the lists above, I've intentionally omitted a few categories:

- Challenges and competitions in adjacent fields like security, data, and math.
- Game programming (e.g. [several frameworks in Ruby](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby#beyond-web-development)) and audio/visual creative coding (e.g. [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) in Ruby) because they are more open-ended than anything above.

## Are coding challenges worthwhile?

*Not necessarily.*

I have a strange fascination with coding challenges. I've spent significant time in several of the categories I outlined above, and I even created [a CLI tool for doing Advent of Code in Ruby](https://github.com/fpsvogel/advent_of_ruby).

My conclusion is that coding challenges are a great way to have fun while writing code, and they're handy for practicing a new language. But if you're looking to improve yourself as a developer in a broad sense, then coding challeges probably aren't the best choice.

## If not coding challenges, then what?

**Marketability** is pretty important these days, when the developer job market is extremely competitive and job security is only imagined.

To that end, **publicly sharing** your work as a developer makes you more visible and can open up job opportunities. This means:

- Write blog posts (like this one!) and sharing them on social media.
- Share shorter content: TILs, or your favorite gems/hacks/resources.
- Contribute to open-source projects that you use.
- Participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) or [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/).
- And do anything else that shows off your abilities while making a genuine contribution.

Essentially, this approach combines **learning with networking**. I'll expand on this in a future post, but I'll leave you with the tidbit that **networking doesn't have to be soul-sucking** and in fact, **it can be just as enjoyable as coding challenges.**
