To many developers, "coding challenge" brings up anxious memories of technical interviews, or grinding LeetCode. But there are so many more kinds of coding challenges. Here's an incomplete list.

## The list

- **Algorithms, interview prep:** LeetCode, HackerRank, and many more that are easy to find ([GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore) is a lesser-known one).
- **Holiday competitions:** [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), [Everybody Codes](https://everybody.codes), and language-specific ones like [Advent of JS](https://www.adventofjs.com) and [Advent of SQL](https://adventofsql.com)
- **Misc. challenges that are not seasonal or very algorithmic:** [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [hackattic](https://hackattic.com/challenges)
- **Learning-oriented:** [Exercism](https://exercism.org)
- **Language-specific practice:** (using Ruby as an example) [Ruby Koans](https://koans.idogawa.com/), [Ruby coding challenges](https://koans.idogawa.com/)
- **Engineering-focused challenges:** [Fly.io Gossip Glomers (distributed systems challenges)](https://fly.io/dist-sys/), [Google Hashcode](https://github.com/pierreavn/google-hashcode-archive)
- **"Build your own X":** [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi), [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x), [Projectbook](https://projectbook.code.brettchalupa.com), [Project-based learning](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning#ruby), and various books: [Build Your Own X From Scratch](https://build-your-own.org/) series; some in Ruby: [Build a Database Server](https://technicaldeft.com/build-a-database-server), [Rebuilding HTTP](https://noahgibbs.gumroad.com/l/rebuilding_http), [Building Git](https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/)
- **Competitive programming:** some good beginner guides on Reddit ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/z4qjzx/a_guide_to_competitive_programming/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/comments/1dv6ttx/competitive_programming_resources_that_i_found/))
- **Code golf:** [code.golf](https://code.golf/), [Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/), [CodinGame - Clash of Code](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode)
- **Gamified open-source contributing:** [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/), [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/)
- **Programming games:** [Screeps](https://screeps.com/), [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/), [SpaceTraders](https://spacetraders.io/), [Artifacts](https://artifactsmmo.com/), [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com)
  - Ruby-specific: [Ruby Warrior](https://palkan.github.io/ruby-warrior/), [SC2AI](https://sc2ai.pages.dev/)
  - JS-specific: [Untrusted](https://untrustedgame.com/), [BitBurner](https://bitburner-official.github.io/), [Elevator Saga](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/)
  - own language: [Swarm](https://swarm-game.github.io/)
  - CSS games: for some reason there are a ton of these
    - [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/)
    - [CSSBattle](https://cssbattle.dev/)
    - [Flex Box Adventure](https://codingfantasy.com/games/flexboxadventure)
    - [Flexbox Defense](http://www.flexboxdefense.com/)
    - [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
    - [Flexbox Zombies](https://flexboxzombies.com/)
    - [Grid Attack](https://codingfantasy.com/games/css-grid-attack)
    - [Grid Critters](https://gridcritters.com/)
    - [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)

### What's not in the list

This list intentionally omits a few categories:

- Challenges and competitions in adjacent fields like security, data, and math.
- Kata, because they were popular with an older generation of TDD/Agile fans (e.g. [cyber-dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org), [Kata-Log](https://kata-log.rocks/tdd), [CodeKata](http://codekata.com/))
- Game programming (e.g. [several frameworks in Ruby](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby#game-programming)) and audio/visual creative coding (e.g. [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) in Ruby) because they are more open-ended than anything above.

## Are coding challenges worthwhile?

I have a strange fascination with coding challenges. Maybe it's because

what to do instead:

- read CS books + share learnings in short and long forms, technical and LinkedIn
- contribute to open source
