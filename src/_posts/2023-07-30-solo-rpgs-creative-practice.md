Today, a very different topic: **solo tabletop role-playing games** (a.k.a. TTRPGs). Normally I write about programming here, but recently with the arrival of my first baby, this blog is suddenly ~~unfocused~~ *eclectic and fun*. But seriously, I wanted to write about solo RPGs because they're helping me become **more creative** and **less paralyzed by perfectionism**.

## How I discovered solo TTRPGs

I enjoy *reading* fiction, but I feel like I'm terrible at *making* it. And since making up silly stories on the fly is a handy skill for a parent, I thought it was a perfect time to confront my creative inhibitions.

But how should I start, if it's those very inhibitions that make any kind of practice routine impossible? It only takes a minute of staring at a blank page (or, worse, the beginning of a story I've written) for me to lose my enthusiasm and run to a more familiar pastime, by which I mean coding.

And yet… once you've realized your #1 hobby is *the same thing that you do all day at work*, and you contemplate the fact that your kid might not end up sharing that interest (at least in the next, let's say, ten years), you become highly motivated to put your eggs in more baskets.

So, how to make creative writing more approachable? I wondered if **making it into a game** might help.

I recalled the handful of *Dungeons & Dragons* sessions that I played a few years ago. *That* was a story-making game, sort of. There was too much *standing around trading blows with trolls* for my taste, but I enjoyed other moments when I was working together with my friends to improvise a story within a game.

Questions flooded into my brain:

- *Is there a more narrative-focused TTRPG?*
- *All the TTRPG groups in my area are for D&D… could I instead play a TTRPG solo, just for the storytelling practice?*
- *Am I crazy for wanting to try this?*

As it turns out, **yes** and **yes** and **probably not**!

After an epic journey of discovery, which started at [/r/Solo_Roleplaying](https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying), I now present to you my findings on solo TTRPGs.

Note that the titles I mention here are not the *most popular* TTRPGs, just the ones that I myself find most interesting. A few minutes perusing the subreddit will show you which ones are most popular. (Or I could just tell you that it's [*Ironsworn*](https://www.ironswornrpg.com).)

And if you want a high-level overview, watch ["A Beginner's Guide to Solo Role Playing (solo RPGs)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYHt1pdScK0).

## The TTRPG that I'm starting with

My favorite find is [*ALONe*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/168609) with *The GameMaster's Apprentice (GMA)* ([online]((https://jamesturneronline.net/game-masters-apprentice)) or [physical cards](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/125685/The-GameMasters-Apprentice-Base-Deck)) and [*GMA Adventure Guide Pack*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/179835).

I like *ALONe* for several reasons:

- It's focused on **narrative** rather than the minutiae of combat.
- It's **freeform**. It works for any setting, rather than being limited by a particular system of stats and skills.
- It's **simple**.
- It's **all-in-one** thanks to the *GMA* cards. Solo role-playing can be a bit cumbersome to a newcomer, in that it involves referencing tables to generate or inspire content. Not so with this one!

Other freeform, narrative-focused TTRPGs that I found interesting are [*Freeform Universal*](https://www.perilplanet.com/freeform-universal) (especially the [2nd edition beta](https://www.perilplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Neon-City-character-sheet-form-fill.pdf)), and [*Risus*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/170294/Risus-The-Anything-RPG) plus the [*Risusverse*](https://www.risusiverse.com/).

But neither of these is *designed* for solo play, so you'd have to supplement them with solo resources (more on that below). For me, *ALONe* is a good starting point because it's a complete and elegant package.

## Honorable mentions

Here are some other TTRPGs that I'll be exploring.

### For kids, and the kid in me

- *Dungeon Hero* ([Vol. 1](https://lonespelunker.itch.io/dungeon-hero), [Vol. 2](https://lonespelunker.itch.io/dungeon-hero-volume-2), [Vol. 3](https://lonespelunker.itch.io/dungeon-hero-volume-3-bump-in-the-night)) and its successor [*Welcome Aboard, Captain*](https://lonespelunker.itch.io/welcome-aboard-captain)

### Going medieval

These are a lot more *crunchy* (as the more numbers-heavy games are described) than I would normally go for, but I just can't resist their medieval literary-historical settings.

## Solo role-playing tools

A lot of the games I listed above are actually designed for group play. But with the right tools, most TTRPGs can be played solo.

## Did it work? We shall see…

I'll add an update here or write a sequel post in the future, when I've had a chance to see whether solo TTRPGs really do help me in my quest for creative freedom. The worst-case scenario is that they'll become yet another form of practice that didn't stick, but at least I'll have given it a try. And who knows? Maybe you, dear reader, will be inspired to give it a try too.
